# Project-SmartCartCustomerClustering-System-Unsupervised-ML-
I developed an Intelligent Customer Segmentation System using Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering Algorithms).  The system analyzes:   ✔ Purchase spending patterns (wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, gold products)   ✔ Purchase frequency (web, store, catalog, deals usage)   ✔ Website engagement (monthly visits)
